BOOST enhanced boilerplate framework
======================================

**BOOST** is a Boilerplate framework that's kind of a best of everything that I find useful. There's a responsive grid (inspired by the 1kbgrid), form styling and many other useful bits and pieces.

### Updates
15/01/2012 - Massive overhaul of the CSS; now LESS is used for everything. I added a new grid system, adapted from the 1kbgrid & Zurb's Foundation grid & LOADS more

26/11/2011 - Fairly major update: Separated boost.css into component parts for better manageability

## CSS
**BOOST** uses the 'mobile-first' methodology & to find out more, please read the excellent post 'Mobile First' by Luke Wroblewski at http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933

#### Grid calculations
There are some nifty calculations (by LESS) for the Boost grid that make creating your own grid setup ridiculously easy. If you're not happy with the structure that I created, please visit http://grid.mindplay.dk & use the tool there to create your own version of the grid.
